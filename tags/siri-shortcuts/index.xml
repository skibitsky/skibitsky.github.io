It gives users more control over all distracting things modern devices do. I have multiple focus modes: for learning, working, reading, etc. There is also one I use for deep work. When doing deep work, I want to avoid being distracted by anything, and therefore I mute almost every app, including Slack. One deep work session can last for up to a few hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
