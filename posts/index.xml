It gives users more control over all distracting things modern devices do. I have multiple focus modes: for learning, working, reading, etc. There is also one I use for deep work. When doing deep work, I want to avoid being distracted by anything, and therefore I mute almost every app, including Slack. One deep work session can last for up to a few hours. During this time, Slack shows that I’m active (green circle next to my name). However, I won’t respond to any messages which can make my coworkers to think that I’m actually slacking (ba dum tss) instead of doing my work.</p>
<p>The solution I come up with is to use Slack API to automatically set status when my deep work focus mode turns on. And disable when it turns off.</p>
<p>Example of Slack Status:

</p>
<p>It works pretty well for me. Despite the fact the automation is handled by Siri Shortcuts on my iPhone, it also works if focus mode is enabled/disabled on a Mac (assuming the iPhone is online).</p>
<p>Below I describe how to do such automation thing in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="0-create-slack-app">0. Create Slack App</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps">https://api.slack.com/apps</a> and click on “Create New App” button.</li>
<li>Enter the app name and select Slack Workspace you want to update your status in.</li>
<li>After the app is created, select to “OAuth &amp; Permissions” from the left menu.</li>
<li>Scroll down to “Scopes” section and add <code>users.profile:write</code> User Token Scope. This will give your app permissions to modify user status.

</li>
<li>The last step is to install your app into workplace. Select “Install App” in the left menu and follow instructions on that page.</li>
<li>After the app is installed is ready, you should be able to copy OAuth token. Don’t share this token with anyone! You will need this token in the next step.

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-configure-siri-shortcuts">1. Configure Siri Shortcuts</h2>
<p>I made two pretty similar Siri Shortcuts: one to enable, and another one to disable Slack status. Both have comments explaining how they work and import questions asking for your Slack OAuth token.</p>
<p><em>Enable Slack Focus Status shortcut</em>

    <img src="https://sandelis.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posts/automation/slack-foucs-status/Enable%20Focus%20Shortcut.webp"  alt="Slack Status"  class="left"  style="border-radius: 3px; width:450px;"  />

</p>
<p>Import both shortcuts and add your Slack OAuth token.</p>

<h2 id="2-set-up-siri-shortcuts-automation">2. Set up Siri Shortcuts Automation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Finally, head over to “Automation” tab on iOS/iPadOS Siri Shortcuts app and create new automation.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the list of your Focus modes and select the one you want to trigger Slack Status.</li>
<li>Choose “When Turning On” and proceed to the next screen.</li>
<li>Add “Run Shortcut” action and select “Enable Slack Focus Status” shortcut.</li>
<li>Tap on “Next” and on the next screen disable “Ask Before Running”.</li>
<li>Create one more automation for the same Focus mode, but this time select “When Turning Off” trigger and “Disable Slack Focus Status” shortcut.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! Now you should be able to automatically share your Focus mode on Slack 🙂</p>
