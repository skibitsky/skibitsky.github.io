Hi, I am Gleb ðŸ‘‹

I am a maker, working mostly on Unity stuff. 

### Values
As libertarian, I stand for equal rights, freedom of expression and [NAP][1]. In people, I value liberty, creativity, and dedication.

### Projects
Planing to make a nice-looking "My Projects" page on this website to write about all cool things I worked on. Meanwhile, you can check out my [GitHub][2] for open-source projects or [LinkedIn][3] for formal experience.

### Education
I don't have a university degree and I regret not dropping out of school when I turned 16. Being very motivated in what I do, I find formal education to be a waste of time and resources.
