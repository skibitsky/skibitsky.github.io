Hi, I am Gleb ðŸ‘‹

I'm very passionate about game development. Worked at many indie projects of different scale as a developer, manager, and advisor.

I've just created this website, more content is coming soon ðŸ˜¸

## Background

In 2016 joined GameInsight as a game developer working on mobile and AR games, but quit after two years to found my own company - [Dragonglass](https://dragonglass.com). Developed and launched the world's first blockchain mobile game along with the Dragonglass ICO. My goal is to shape the future of the gaming industry and bring blockchain to mass adoption ðŸš€
