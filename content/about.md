Hi, I am Gleb ðŸ‘‹

I am maker working mostly on Unity stuff. 

### Projects
Planing to make a nice-looking "My Projects" page on this website to write about all cool things I worked on. Meanwhile you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/skibitsky) for open source projects or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/skibitsky/) for formal experience.

### Education
I don't have university degree and I regret not dropping out of school when I turned 16. Being very motivated in what I do, I find formal education to be a waste of time and resources. 

### Values
In people I value liberty, creativity and dedication. 

Happy to be alive for the first and last time.
