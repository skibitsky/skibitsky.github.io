Hi, I am Gleb ðŸ‘‹

I'm very passionate about game development. Worked at many projects of different scale as a developer, manager, and advisor.

I am still working on this website, more content is coming soon ðŸ˜¸

## Background

In 2016 joined [GameInsight](https://game-insight.com) as a game developer working on mobile and AR games, but quit after two years to found my own company - [Dragonglass](https://dragonglass.com). Developed and launched the world's first blockchain mobile game along with the Dragonglass ICO. At Dragonglass our goal was to shape the future of the gaming industry and bring blockchain to the mass adoption ðŸš€

Now I am leading [Different](https://different.lt) - creative software agency, offering a full development cycle of games and interactive experiences ðŸŒˆ
