Funny online first-person shooter. Think about it as Team Fortress 2 + Minecraft. From TF2 it borrowed cartoony visual style, humour, and the idea of characters with different mechanics. Minecraft inspired us to add independent NPCs and sandbox mechanics allowing players to build simple constructions.

The project hasn’t been launched, sources were lost. I uploaded all screenshots and renders I’d found [there][1].

### Stack
	Art: Blender, GIMP, ZBrush
	Dev: Unity, Unet, MonoDevelop

### Cubic Map
One of the ideas was to make maps cubic. Each side of the cube represented a different landscape and environment, forcing players to choose different play styles.

Standing next to the edge, the player wouldn’t see what’s happening on another side. A few steps further — and he/she would be standing on another face of the cube. 

As far as I can remember, we decided to build it gradually– we were making each face as a separate plane to combine them into one cube after we were satisfied with the level design of each face.

### NPCs
We wanted to make players fight not only against each other, but also against the aggressive world. Since funniness was one of our main pillars, the NPCs had to be funny too. For example, one of them was the huge flying logo of Internet Explorer slowing down everything in a certain range.

### Guns
At that time we played Battlefield and airsoft a lot. I think it made us interested in weapons, and hence all firearms used to mimic the real ones. Except the colour. We made them _very_ colourful. Showing these renders and screenshots to other people, we received mostly positive feedback. It looked a bit weird but memorable.

Besides firearm replicas there was a bunch of other guns like axes and katanas.
