This page describes software and hardware I use. Other people [also do][1] such lists. I don't know why.

## Hardware
* MacBook Pro 15
* Planck Ez
* Razer Deathadder
* iPhone 8 Plus
* AirPods Pro and Marshall Major II
* Raspberry Pi Zero to host [Pi Hole]()(https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) and  Pi 4 for other things
* Nintendo Switch 

## Browsers
* [Safari][3] — my main browser. It's fast and respects privacy.
* [Firefox][4] - amazing open-source browser. I would use it as my main browser if it had a level of synchronisation between Mac and iPhone that Safari has
* [Lagrange][5] - open source [gemini][6] client

## Productivity
* [Things 3][7] - my task management system. All my personal, hobby, study and work tasks live there. It has many powerful features and pleasant design (Apple Design Award)
* [Alfred][8] - it is not just a spotlight (default and powerful search interface on macOS) replacement, it’s a command centre. I use different workflows more than a hundred times per day. Some of them will be referenced below. Also, I use [current-task][9] workflow as the core element of the whole CT (Current Task) system. It is based on my [alfred-timing][10] workflow
* [Bear][11] - note-taking app. All notes are stored in iCloud. Has Markdown and media support. Besides regular notes, Bear is my [personal knowledge base][12]. I access my notes using [this][13] Alfred workflow that allows me to quickly open a floating window with any note 
	![][image-2]
	I can then export the note from Bear (I prefer PDF) to share it with somebody
* [Fantastical 2][14] - my favourite calendar app. Has [NLP][15] support
* [MindNode][16] - an app for creating mind maps. I use it during brainstorming sessions, ideas, visual information structuring and for many other things
* [Keyboard Maestro][17] - the core app of macOS automation. I started using it last year and already have \~200 macros that boost my productivity a lot

## Code
* [JetBrains Rider][18] - cross-platform .NET IDE based on IntelliJ and ReSharper
* [Visual Studio Code][19] - hackable electron-based code editor. Use it when working with Go, Solidity or JS. Used [Atom][20] before
* [Xcode][21] - Apple’s IDE. Mostly used to build Unity project for iOS

## Development
* [Unity][22] - my favourite real-time 3D development platform. Use it for my work and hobby games and apps
* [Tower][23] - GUI Git Client of my choice. Before I used SourceTree, GitHub Desktop and GitKraken
* [Dash][24] - offline documentation browser. I store gigabytes of documentation locally and search it via Dash’s Alfred workflow. This way I always have instant access to all documentation I need
* [iTerm2][25] - terminal emulator for macOS. On Windows, I use [Windows Terminal][26]
* [Paw][27] - powerful and fast native HTTP client. I used [Insomnia][28] made with Electron.
* [TablePlus][29] - databas management app
* [Transmit][30] - an app for accessing remote storages such as SFTP, S3 servers or Google Drive. Use it a lot at work because web interface of Google Drive is slow.
* [Docker Desktop][31] - containers management

## Graphics and Design
* [Pixelmator Pro][32] - my favourite image editing tool. The team behind the app is very focused on integrating all features Apple ecosystem provides, including [Machine Learning][33]
* [Figma][34] - collaborative prototyping tool

## Privacy and Security
* [1Password][35] - password manager
* [Backblaze][36] - encrypted cloud backups
* [Micro Snitch][37] - track camera and mic usage. An alternative to [OverSight][38] but without annoying notifications

## Tools and misc
* [Reeder][39] - RSS reader
* [Transmission][40] - BitTorrent client
* [Archiver][41] - archive manager. Supports all major formats and has minimalistic UI.
* [Permute][42] - media format converter
* [Mate Translate][43] - handy translator app
* [Lungo][44] - prevents Mac from going to sleep
* [CleanShot][45] - a solid replacement for default macOS Screenshot app

## Communication
* [Telegram][46] - open-source instant messaging app. I use native macOS client because it has more features over the Qt one (i.e. secret chats)
* [Slack][47] - work communication
* [FaceTime][48] - the best software for video calls

## Office
* [iWork][49] - native apps for working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Support collaboration and have web version.

## Software Management
* [Setapp][50] - 100+ macOS apps available for €10 per month. Some of them have their subscription when buying directly, so paying for Setapp can be a good money saver :) 
* [CleanMyMac][51] - powerful software to clean Mac using different tools
* [JetBrains Toolbox][52] - an app to manage JetBrains’ IDEs.

## System Customisation
* [TripMode][53] - allows whitelisting certain apps when on mobile network to save traffic
* [Bartender][54] - menu bar customisation
* [Karabiner-Elements ][55]- open-source kernel extension to customise keyboard
* [Contexts][56] - Command-Tab replacement. Unlike the default one, Contexts allows switching between windows instead of apps. It also has a nice search feature
* [gSwitch][57] - open-source menu bar app that allows control over the GPU

## Safari Extensions
* [DarkReader][58] - enables dark mode for all websites
* [Wipr][59] - ad blocker. Used uBlock Origin before.
* [Vimari][60] - provides keyboard-based navigation. Port of Vimium.
