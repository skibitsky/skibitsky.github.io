This page describes software I use. Other people [also do](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses/#awesome-uses-) such lists. I don't know why.

## Browsers
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) - my main browser. It's fast and respects privacy
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) - amazing open source browser. I would use it as my main browser if it had a level of synchronisation between Mac and iPhone that Safari has

## Productivity 
* [Things 3](http://culturedcode.com) - my task management system. All my personal, hobby, study and work tasks live there. It has a lot of powerful features and pleasant design (Apple Design Award)
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - it is not just a spotlight (default and powerful search interface on macOS) replacement, itâ€™s a command centre. I use different workflows more than a hundred times per day. Some of them will be referenced below. Also, I use [current-task](https://github.com/skibitsky/current-task) workflow as the core element of the whole CT (Current Task) system. It is based on my [alfred-timing](https://github.com/skibitsky/alfred-timing) workflow
* [Bear](https://bear.app) - note taking app. All notes are stored in iCloud. Has Markdown and media support. Besides regular notes, Bear is my [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base). I access my notes using [this](https://github.com/drgrib/alfred-bear) Alfred workflow that allows me to quickly open a floating window with any note 
	![](https://skibitsky.com/images/alfred-bear-screenshot.png)
	I can then export the note from Bear (I prefer PDF) to share it with somebody
