This page describes software and hardware I use. Other people [also do][1] such lists. I don't know why.

## Hardware
* MacBook Pro 16 M1 Max
* Planck Ez
* Razer Deathadder
* iPhone 13
* AirPods Pro and Marshall Major II
* Raspberry Pi Zero to host [Pi Hole][2] and  Pi 4 for other things
* Nintendo Switch, PS5

## Browsers
* [Safari][3] — my main browser. It's fast and respects privacy.
* [Firefox][4] - amazing open-source browser. I would use it as my main browser if it had a level of synchronisation between Mac and iPhone that Safari has

## Productivity
* [Things 3][5] - my task management system. All my personal, hobby, study and work tasks live there. It has many powerful features and pleasant design (Apple Design Award)
* [Alfred][6] - it is not just a spotlight (default and powerful search interface on macOS) replacement, it’s a command centre. I use different workflows more than a hundred times per day. Some of them will be referenced below. Also, I use [current-task][7] workflow as the core element of the whole CT (Current Task) system. It is based on my [alfred-timing][8] workflow
* [Bear][9] - note-taking app. All notes are stored in iCloud. Has Markdown and media support. Besides regular notes, Bear is my [personal knowledge base][10]. I access my notes using [this][11] Alfred workflow that allows me to quickly open a floating window with any note 
	![][image-1]
	I can then export the note from Bear (I prefer PDF) to share it with somebody
* [MindNode][12] - an app for creating mind maps. I use it during brainstorming sessions, ideas, visual information structuring and for many other things
* [Keyboard Maestro][13] - the core app of macOS automation. I started using it last year and already have \~200 macros that boost my productivity a lot

## Code
* [JetBrains Rider][14] - cross-platform .NET IDE based on IntelliJ and ReSharper
* [JetBrains WebStorm][15] - for web development
* [Xcode][16] - Apple’s IDE. Mostly used to build Unity project for iOS

## Development
* [Unity][17] - my favourite real-time 3D development platform. Use it for my work and hobby games and apps
* [Tower][18] - GUI Git Client of my choice. Before I used SourceTree, GitHub Desktop and GitKraken
* [Dash][19] - offline documentation browser. I store gigabytes of documentation locally and search it via Dash’s Alfred workflow. This way I always have instant access to all documentation I need
* [iTerm2][20] - terminal emulator for macOS. On Windows, I use [Windows Terminal][21]
* [Paw][22] - powerful and fast native HTTP client. I used [Insomnia][23] made with Electron.
* [TablePlus][24] - databas management app
* [Transmit][25] - an app for accessing remote storages such as SFTP, S3 servers or Google Drive. Use it a lot at work because web interface of Google Drive is slow.
* [Docker Desktop][26] - containers management

## Graphics and Design
* [Pixelmator Pro][27] - my favourite image editing tool. The team behind the app is very focused on integrating all features Apple ecosystem provides, including [Machine Learning][28]
* [Figma][29] - collaborative prototyping tool

## Privacy and Security
* [1Password][30] - password manager
* [Backblaze][31] - encrypted cloud backups
* [Micro Snitch][32] - track camera and mic usage. An alternative to [OverSight][33] but without annoying notifications

## Tools and misc
* [Reeder][34] - RSS reader
* [Transmission][35] - BitTorrent client
* [Archiver][36] - archive manager. Supports all major formats and has minimalistic UI.
* [Permute][37] - media format converter
* [Mate Translate][38] - handy translator app
* [Lungo][39] - prevents Mac from going to sleep
* [CleanShot][40] - a solid replacement for default macOS Screenshot app

## Communication
* [Telegram][41] - open-source instant messaging app. I use native macOS client because it has more features over the Qt one (i.e. secret chats)
* [Slack][42] - work communication
* [FaceTime][43] - the best software for video calls

## Office
* [iWork][44] - native apps for working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Support collaboration and have web version.

## Software Management
* [Setapp][45] - 100+ macOS apps available for €10 per month. Some of them have their subscription when buying directly, so paying for Setapp can be a good money saver :) 
* [JetBrains Toolbox][46] - an app to manage JetBrains’ IDEs.

## System Customisation
* [TripMode][47] - allows whitelisting certain apps when on mobile network to save traffic
* [Bartender][48] - menu bar customisation
* [Karabiner-Elements ][49]- open-source kernel extension to customise keyboard

## Safari Extensions
* [DarkReader][50] - enables dark mode for all websites
* [Wipr][51] - ad blocker. Used uBlock Origin before.
