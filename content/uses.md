## Browsers
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) - my main browser. It is fast, respects privacy and [RAM](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.ZGLehLtVxlR6iIMBecQDIgHaHa%26pid%3DApi&f=1)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) - amazing open source browser. I would use it as my main browser if it had a level of synchronisation between Mac and iPhone that Safari has
* [Brave](https://brave.com) - if suddenly I need Chromium, I use Brave

## Productivity

I use different workflows more than a hundred times per day. Some of them will be referenced below. Also, I use [current-task](https://github.com/skibitsky/current-task) workflow as the core element of the whole CT (Current Task) system. It is based on my [alfred-timing](https://github.com/skibitsky/alfred-timing) workflow
* [Bear](https://bear.app) - note taking app. All notes are stored in iCloud. Has Markdown and media support. Besides regular notes, Bear is my [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base). I access my notes using [this](https://github.com/drgrib/alfred-bear) Alfred workflow that allows me to quickly open a floating window with any note
