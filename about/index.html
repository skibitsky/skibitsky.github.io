<p>Hi, I am Gleb ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very passionate about game development. Worked at many projects of different scale as a developer, manager, and advisor.</p>

<p>I am still working on this website, more content is coming soon ðŸ˜¸</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I am very passionate about game and software development.</p>

<p>Worked at many indie projects of different scale as a developer, manager, and advisor. At the age of 16 started my career at <a href="https://game-insight.com">GameInsight</a> as a game developer working on mobile and AR games, but quit after two years to found my own company - <a href="https://dragonglass.com">Dragonglass</a>.</p>

<p>As the Dragonglass CTO, developed and launched the world&rsquo;s first blockchain mobile game along with the Dragonglass ICO.
After promoting to the CEO, started working on an ecosystem to connect games with the blockchain to let developers monetize games in new ways, gain control over the secondary market and allow players to transit progress between different games. We were the first company working on a solution for traditional games to enable blockchain in a seamless and player-friendly way.
At Dragonglass our goal was to shape the future of the gaming industry and bring blockchain to the mass adoption ðŸš€</p>

<p>Now I am leading <a href="https://different.lt">Different</a> - creative software agency, offering a full development cycle of games and interactive experiences ðŸŒˆ</p>
