# skibitsky.com [![Deploy on GH Pages](https://github.com/skibitsky/skibitsky.github.io/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/skibitsky/skibitsky.github.io/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml)

I use [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/skibitsky/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme becasue of its simplicity and system-based dark mode support.

The markdown and Hugo files are on the [`source`](https://github.com/skibitsky/skibitsky.github.io/tree/source) branch. When the [`source`](https://github.com/skibitsky/skibitsky.github.io/tree/source) branch changes, a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/skibitsky/skibitsky.github.io/actions) will automatically push the rendered version of the site to the [`master`](https://github.com/skibitsky/skibitsky.github.io/tree/master) branch.

I also use [Link Checker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/link-checker) action which runs once a month to checks all markdown files for broken links and create an issue assigned to me if there is any.
