It gives users more control over all distracting things modern devices do. I have multiple focus modes: for learning, working, reading, etc. There is also one I use for deep work. When doing deep work, I want to avoid being distracted by anything, and therefore I mute almost every app, including Slack. One deep work session can last for up to a few hours.</description></item><item><title>Cities</title><link>/photos/cities/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 16:48:57 +0300</pubDate><guid>/photos/cities/</guid><description>Madrid, Spain
